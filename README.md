# Sleeping music

This project aims to create stupid and pointless automations that may or may not improve quality of my life <br>

```
python -B -m src.sleeping_music --time 22:45
```
### Sets an alarm by playing an 'alarm sound' video on youtube at given timing
```
python -B -m src.alarm --time 08:00
```
